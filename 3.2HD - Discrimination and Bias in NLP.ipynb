    "To better understand bias and discrimination in AI, in this assignment, we will look at a Natural Language Processing use case. \n",

    "Natural Language Pocessing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that helps computers to understand, to interpret and to manipulate natural (i.e. human) language.\n",
    "Imagine NLP-powered machines as black boxes that are capable of understanding and evaluating the context of the input documents (i.e. collection of words), outputting meaningful results that depend on the task the machine is designed for.\n",

    "Just like any other machine learning algorithm, biased data results in biased outcomes. And just like any other algorithm, results debiasing is painfully annoying, to the point that it might be simpler to unbias the society itself.\n",

    "# The big deal: word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Words must be represented as **numeric vectors** in order to be fed into machine learning algorithms. One of the most powerful (and popular) ways to do it is through **Word Embeddings**. In word embedding models, each word in a given language is assigned to a high-dimensional vector, such that **the geometry of the vectors captures relations between the words**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because word embeddings are very computionally expensive to train, most ML practitioners will load a pre-trained set of embeddings. \n",

    "**After this assignment you will be able to:**\n",

    "- Load pre-trained word vectors, and measure similarity using cosine similarity\n",
    "- Use word embeddings to solve word analogy problems such as Man is to Woman as King is to ______. \n",

    "In the following exercise, you will examine gender biases that can be reflected in a word embedding, and explore algorithms for reducing the bias. In addition to learning about the topic of debiasing, this exercise will also help hone your intuition about what word vectors are doing. This section involves a bit of linear algebra, though you can probably complete it even without being expert in linear algebra, and we encourage you to give it a shot. \n",

    "Lets first see how the GloVe word embeddings relate to gender. You will first compute a vector $g = e_{woman}-e_{man}$, where $e_{woman}$ represents the word vector corresponding to the word *woman*, and $e_{man}$ corresponds to the word vector corresponding to the word *man*. The resulting vector $g$ roughly encodes the concept of \"gender\". (You might get a more accurate representation if you compute $g_1 = e_{mother}-e_{father}$, $g_2 = e_{girl}-e_{boy}$, etc. and average over them. But just using $e_{woman}-e_{man}$ will give good enough results for now.) \n"

    "These debiasing algorithms are very helpful for reducing bias, but are not perfect and do not eliminate all traces of bias. For example, one weakness of this implementation was that the bias direction $g$ was defined using only the pair of words _woman_ and _man_. As discussed earlier, if $g$ were defined by computing $g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$; $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$; $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on and averaging over them, you would obtain a better estimate of the \"gender\" dimension in the 50 dimensional word embedding space. Feel free to play with such variants as well.  \n",
